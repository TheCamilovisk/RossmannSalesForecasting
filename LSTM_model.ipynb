    "# Time Series Forecasting Project using LSTM and PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll use the PyTorch library to develop a time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is particularly well-suited for time series data due to its ability to capture temporal dependencies and patterns over time. This project will go through several stages, including data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation, leveraging PyTorch’s capabilities to build an effective forecasting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Long Short-Term Memory Models\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM models are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to handle long-range dependencies in sequential data. Their architecture allows them to capture both short-term and long-term patterns, which is crucial for tasks like time series forecasting and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard RNNs, as the length of the input sequence increases, the gradients tend to either become very small (vanish) or very large (explode), due to the multiplicative gradient that can exponentially decrease or increase through layers. [Vanishing gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem) make the network unable to learn from long-range dependencies because the information gets lost over the layers. On the other hand, exploding gradients can lead to unstable networks where the model weights can oscillate or diverge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the ability of LSTMs to remember information over long periods makes them exceptionally well-suited for time-series data, where understanding the context and dependencies over time is crucial. Whether it's predicting stock prices, analyzing weather patterns, or understanding speech, LSTMs can maintain a stable learning process over these sequences, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.\n",

    "The LSTM key components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cell State (C):** Acts as a container for storing memories, helping the LSTM retain information over time. It's updated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   C_t = F_t ⊙ C_{t-1} + I_t ⊙ \\tilde{C}_t\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "   where $C_t$ is the new cell state, $f_t$ is the forget gate's activation, $i_t$ is the input gate's activation, and $\\tilde{C}_t$ is the candidate cell state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gates:** Function like valves that control the flow of information into and out of the memory cell.\n",
    "   - **Forget Gate (F):** Determines which parts of the memory can be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     F_t = \\sigma(X_tW_{xf} + H_{t-1}W_{hf} + b_f)\n",

    "\n",
    "   - **Input Gate (F) and Candidate Cell State ($\\tilde{C}$):** Updates the memory cell with new data from the current input.\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     I_t = \\sigma(X_tW_{xi} + H_{t-1}W_{hi} + b_i)\n",

    "     $$\n",
    "     \\tilde{C}_t = \\tanh(X_tW_{xc} + H_{t-1}W_{hc} + b_C)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Output Gate (O):** Decides the output based on the current contents of the memory cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     O_t = \\sigma(X_tW_{xo} + H_{t-1}W_{ho} + b_o)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hidden State (H):** The hidden state is updated using the output gate and the cell state.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   H_t = O_t ⊙ \\tanh(C_t)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In these equations, $W$ and $b$ are the weights and biases specific to each gate, $\\sigma$ represents the sigmoid function, and $\\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function.\n",
